Natural Language Processing â€‘ Song lyrics emotion analysis in relation to the time of creation

The purpose of the project was to investigate how the time of creation of a song affects
emotions/mood in these songs. The results provide a sentiment analysis of music people create and
consequently listen to in relation to the general situation in the world. The analysis is based on song
lyrics.
